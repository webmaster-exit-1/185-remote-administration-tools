This enables you to play a selection of notes on the PC that the server is installed on to. 
You also have the option of hearing what you are playing, and also 
creating an active buzz to further disrupt the sound flow of the host's PC. 
Towards the top of the tab, the ability to play a custom sound is provided. 
A custom sound involves you having the ability to pick the note played, 
as well as the length of time that it is played for.
