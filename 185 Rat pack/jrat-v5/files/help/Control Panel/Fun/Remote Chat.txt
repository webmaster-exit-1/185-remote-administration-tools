The remote chat opens a Java window on the host's machine, in which you can send them messages, 
and they will be able to respond and send you messages too. In the lower text box you can enter 
the message which you want to send, and once you have finished typing you click the 'Send' button. 
If you find that you are not getting a response you can click the 'Nudge' button, 
which will cause the Chat window on the host's machine to vibrate suddenly.
