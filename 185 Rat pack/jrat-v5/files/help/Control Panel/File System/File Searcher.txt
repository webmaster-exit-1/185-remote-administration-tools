File Searcher:
This feature is similar to the file manager option - it 
allows you to browse the files in the hosting PC. However, 
using this feature you can search for a specific file or location. 
When searching, you can either choose the 'clear' option, the 'path contains' 
option or the 'name contains' option. Path contains will search for a file which 
is inside a file with the searched phrase - for example searching for 'Orange' and 
finding the file 'Apple' - which is located in a folder called 'Orange juice'. 
The name contains will find a file which has the search term inside it, so searching for 
'Call of Duty' and finding a file called 'Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3'. 
The clear option will simply clear the desired folder.
