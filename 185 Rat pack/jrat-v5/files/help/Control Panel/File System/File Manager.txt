This is the feature which enables you to browse the 
folders in the hosting PC. The folders on the left hand 
side are the folders which are in your PC, and the folders 
which appear in the right (after you click the refresh button) 
are the folders which are currently in the host's PC. In order 
to navigate through both your files and the server's files double 
click the folder you want to enter, and click the back arrow to go 
up a level. To delete a file select the 'x' button, and to refresh 
the folder click the refresh button. If you want to create a new folder 
in the specified location, press the button which is to the right of the 
delete button. In order to transfer the files into your computer, right 
click on the desired file and select the 'download' option (third one down). 
If you want to run the file on the computer - for example a .exe file on the host's computer - 
right click it and then select the 'run' option. On the right click menu, there are many more 
options too, including the 'corrupt' option - this corrupts the file making it unable to be opened, 
the MD5 hash option, which will return the MD5 hash of the file. You can also rename the file/folder through 
the right click menu, as well as many other options!
