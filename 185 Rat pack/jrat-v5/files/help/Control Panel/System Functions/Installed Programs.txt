This merely gives you a list of 
all the user's programs into one window. 
You can refresh the list, in the case of the host 
installing something new, or you can clear the programs 
currently in the list. If the programs are not showing up correctly, 
make sure you have the correct 
destination selected (the dropdown list next to the 'clear' button).
