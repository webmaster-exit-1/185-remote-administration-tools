You can customize the ping icons that will be shown

By default, you can choose between circles, and normal icons.
These can be changed by replacing the file range ping0.png to ping5.png
in the Client.jar archive when it is not running, in the 
/com/redpois0n/icons folder.
and replacing it with the files to your liking.
