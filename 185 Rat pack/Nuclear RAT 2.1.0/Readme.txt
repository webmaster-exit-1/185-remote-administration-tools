Plugins, tutorial or language files:
Check the website for either language files,
plugins, or a tutorial for Nuclear RAT.
You may translate Nuclear RAT using the
DKLang Translator Software, loading
the "client.dklang" file. If you want
me to put any plugins, tutorials or
language files on the NWC website,

=====================================
Important notes about client functionality:
To get a quick help about some function, 
click the "?" sign next to it to show
the help. The best fonts for the client are
Tahoma and Arial Unicode MS (the later have
support for ALL languages)
All windows in the client have two hotkeys,
ESC and F1. When you press F1, the current
focused client window (let's say, File Manager)
will become hidden, that can be shown again
clicking in the "Opened windows" part.
When you press ESC, the current focused
window will be closed (and any information
that was previously displayed is lost)
=====================================
Bug reporting, suggestion, critics:
Visit the forums or email me (information
on the website)
