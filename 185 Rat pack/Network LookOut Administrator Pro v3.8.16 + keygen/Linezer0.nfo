€€≤ €           used as a substitute to the original disks for backup     € ≤€€
€€≤ €           and archiving purposes. This is convenient if you         € ≤€€

€€≤ €           does not come from the original software authors.         € ≤€€
€€≤ €           However we strive to make perfect releases so the         € ≤€€
€€≤ €           chances of something like that happening are slim.        € ≤€€

€€≤ €    rights to circumvent any copy protection. Keep this in mind      € ≤€€
€€≤ €    as the penalties for doing so there are harder than if you       € ≤€€
€€≤ €    stole the actual title from the self. Our base of operation      € ≤€€
€€≤ €    however is not located in the states, and thus we are not        € ≤€€
€€≤ €    bound by any of the legislations like ìno electronic theft actî  € ≤€€
€€≤ €    ìdigital millennium copyright actî or ìthe patriot actî. But     € ≤€€
