# 185+ R.A.T's #

## This is a collection of 185 or more Remote Administration Tools (server and client(for most of them)) for research and for historical records and as an archive.

### RATS? ###

* 	A remote administration tool (**RAT**) is a software program that gives you the ability to control another device remotely. <br>
	You then have access to the device's system as if you had physical access to the device itself.
* 	**RAT**s <u>can</u> be used <u>Legitimately</u>. <br>
	For example, when you have a technical problem on your work computer, sometimes your corporate **IT** guys will use a **RAT** to access your computer and fix the issue. <br>
* 	**RAT**s <u>can</u> also be used <u>Ill-legitimately</u>. <br>
	Besides **IT** another group of people who use **RAT**s are **hackers** trying to do harm to your device or gain access to your information for malicious purposes.

### Do all of them work? ###

* 	I don't know.

### Will I go to jail for using these tools? ###

* 	If you are doing something illegal. <br>
	Probably.

### Will these tools harm my PC? ###

* 	I don't know.
* 	I have not tested them all.
* 	If you decide to research any, I suggest a heavily controlled sandboxed virtual machine or on a designated lab computer meant for this type of research.

### Who do I talk to if something goes wrong? ###

* 	Not me.

## Happy Researching. ##
